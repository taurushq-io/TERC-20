# Low Issues

## L-1: Centralization Risk for trusted owners

> Acknowledge

Contracts have owners with privileged rights to perform admin tasks and need to be trusted to not perform malicious updates or drain funds.

<details><summary>1 Found Instances</summary>


- Found in src/TERC20Standalone.sol [Line: 14](src/TERC20Standalone.sol#L14)

	```solidity
	    AccessControl,
	```

</details>



## L-2: Solidity pragma should be specific, not wide

> We define the version in the config file to allow more flexibility

Consider using a specific version of Solidity in your contracts instead of a wide version. For example, instead of `pragma solidity ^0.8.0;`, use `pragma solidity 0.8.0;`

<details><summary>2 Found Instances</summary>

	```solidity

	```solidity
	pragma solidity ^0.8.28;
	```

</details>



## L-3: `public` functions not used internally could be marked `external`

> Since external does not save gas, we prefer to put it public to allow them to be called by other smart contract

Instead of marking a function as `public`, consider marking it as `external` if it is not used internally.

## L-4: PUSH0 is not supported by all chains

> Acknowledge

Solc compiler version 0.8.20 switches the default target EVM version to Shanghai, which means that the generated bytecode will include PUSH0 opcodes. Be sure to select the appropriate EVM version in case you intend to deploy on a chain other than mainnet like L2 chains that may not support PUSH0, otherwise deployment of your contracts will fail.

## L-5: Potentially unused `private` / `internal` state variables found.

> Part of ERC-7201.
>
> The constant is used by _getTERC20UpgradeableStorage through assembly

State variable appears to be unused. No analysis has been performed to see if any inilne assembly references it. So if that's not the case, consider removing this unused variable.

State variable changes in this function but no event is emitted.
